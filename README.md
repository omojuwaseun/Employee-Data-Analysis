# Employee-Data-Analysis
In this project, I worked with a comprehensive dataset containing detailed information about employees within the company. My task is to leverage SQL to explore and analyze the dataset, extracting valuable insights to aid in understanding the company’s workforce better. This project also takes it a step further by visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) through a dynamic Power BI dashboard.

## The dataset included columns like:
Employee ID

Full Name

Job Title

Department

Business Unit

Gender

Ethnicity

Age

Hire Date

Annual Salary

Bonus Percentage

Country

City

Exit Date

## Project Objectives:
Analyze employee data using SQL to uncover insights.
Transform the insights into meaningful KPIs.
Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize the KPIs.
The main goal is to extract insightful data and statistics to support different HR and business choices. We have a series of questions, and we will take them one after the other in this article.

### Employee Overview: 
First, I perform a basic query to obtain all employee entries in order to get a comprehensive view of the employee data.


### Department Insights: 
I then go into departmental data, figuring out how many people work in each division. Here, the IT department is the highest with 277 employees, and finance is the lowest with 98 employees.


### Demographic analysis:
I then looked at how employees were distributed among genders and races to provide important insights on diversity and inclusion.


### In order to provide insights on diversity and incentive schemes,
I also examine the bonus percentage distribution among various ethnic groups.


### Salary Trends: 
Further, I assessed the average salary’s historical development, taking into account factors that may have an impact on pay plans.
Knowing the average pay for a certain job title also provides information about equity and compensation plans.
Comparing the average bonus percentages across different departments helps assess performance and incentive programs.
I also identified which department boasts the highest average bonus percentage, aiding in assessing performance and rewards, and that proved to be the accounting department with an average bonus of 11.83%.


### Employee Tenure: By identifying employees who exited within their first year and those who’ve been with the company for over 10 years, we analyze retention patterns and employee loyalty.



### Business Unit Salaries: To assist with resource allocation and planning, we compute the total yearly salary cost for each business unit. Specialty products have the highest salary expenditure, with a total of $29.3 million.


### City-Based Analysis: Understanding the average age of employees in each city may guide HR strategies tailored to specific locations.


I also figured out who the company’s top five earners are; this information may be important for evaluating pay and identifying talent.


I also tried to identify employees who have left the company and calculate their average tenure, assisting in understanding retention and attrition patterns. A total of 103 employees have been with the company since the beginning of the business.


This project integrates SQL queries to extract and analyze a wide range of employee-related data, generating insights critical for making informed HR and business decisions.


### INSIGHTS:

With a total of 1,000 employees—515 females and 418 males—there seems to be a fair distribution of genders at the organization.

In regards to diversity and race, Asians make up the largest number of employees (43%), with blacks coming in last at 6.7%. They also get the highest percent of the bonus given to the employees.

The IT department has the highest number of employees in the organization, with 277 employees, and Finance has the lowest, with 98 employees.

About 634 of the employees come from the United States, 227 from China, and 139 from Brazil.

Specialty products from the business units make the highest salary in the organization's

The accounting department gets the highest average bonus with 11.8%, and IT gets the lowest average bonus with 4.2%.

### RECOMMENDATIONS:

With 515 women and 418 men, the company appears to have a well-balanced gender distribution. The company must continue to promote a diverse and inclusive workplace in order to maintain this equilibrium and ensure equal opportunities for all.

Given that Asians make up the largest employee group and receive the highest percentage of bonuses, consider implementing diversity and inclusion initiatives to foster an inclusive workplace. Ensure fair opportunities and recognition for all ethnic groups.

Given that the IT Department employed the largest number of people (277), the company must continue to prioritize effective resource management and make sure IT is adequately staffed to meet its technological demands.
Despite having the fewest employees (98), the finance department ought to assess whether more personnel or resources are needed for efficient financial administration.

Specialty Product Units: Maintain your investments in these divisions to draw and keep top people because of their higher wages.
Accounting Department: Take note of the higher bonus percentage (11.8%) in this department and consider whether other departments could benefit from implementing a similar system of performance-based incentives to increase employee engagement and output.
